      <p class="page_section_content"> <p class="page_section_paragraph"> Everyone has the right to an education. Society pushes this idea on all people in the modern age, yet I believe that nobody really knows what this means anymore. Not too long ago education was an afterthought to the growth of a person. I’m referring to a time when keeping your son from school to work on the farm during the harvest was not just accepted, it was expected. People have slowly transitioned from this form of thinking to one where learning is a necessity for all youth. In a relatively short time, the growth of technology has pushed society into agreeing that higher education is necessary.  For quite a while getting a high school diploma was the accepted goal necessary to enter the work force.  Now, we are fast moving toward a time where the only way to attain a reasonable job is to attend college and obtain needed skills. I believe this is a step in the right direction; however, there needs to be more growth in this direction. We need to examine what an education is and how it functions in modern society. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> Coming to university has taught me many things, among the most important, that the education comes at the hands of your own effort and want to learn. The realization that there is something, whether it is some job or opportunity or achievement, which can drive you to fulfillment, is the greatest motivator for an education. For example, how do we solve the world’s problems? We find someone who loves to solve problems and put them to the task because their fire and drive will carry them to lose themselves until the late hours of the night searching for answers. It seems to me that there is no push for students to find the things that they love. There is a definite monotony in the way that students are forced to endure classes and experiences that don’t benefit them. All of us go through these experiences and supposedly learn, but at what cost? The cost isn’t that there is wasted time but that these opportunities are not used for learning. Classes are taken to be passed from a grade perspective and then all information is forgotten subsequently after the end of the class. </p>
 <p class="page_section_paragraph"> I believe this issue doesn’t lie only with the student. Teachers structure their classes to give students a better chance on standardized tests in order to bring money to the school and raise a school’s reputation. This is not to say that teachers are corrupt or not interested in molding students into good and intelligent people. School systems dictate the curriculum for these tests. All students then are forced towards a base line in certain subjects that are chosen as the most important. I say this with disdain because many subjects such as art and music are not given any energy and I believe that these subjects are especially important early on if they are to garner any interest. I believe this approach is archaic not because giving people a strong base in some subjects is wrong, but because they block exploration into subjects and classes that are relevant and important for many. By the time that someone is no longer required to take base classes after high school, it is almost too late to discover something that could bring success and happiness in a career. So many people lose their chance. Some are saved by exploring in college, as I was, but many are stuck not knowing the options they may have had. I believe a more forward approach is necessary in a day and age where knowing your options and being able to adapt is the most important. </p>  
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> All of this so far seems very abstract and, in general, like a complaint about modern society, but let me tell you a story. I’ve found that I love stories in my career and I believe they are the best way for me to transmit information. When I came to school at CU Boulder I chose my major of computer science because the vaguest idea I had of a career for myself included computers. I liked them and was at least interested in learning more. What I found as I continued through my university career was that I had severely misunderstood my own interests. Coding as a computer scientist could be interesting and fulfilling, but most of the time it left me exhausted, frustrated, and feeling unaccomplished. The few times that I felt like I really understood what was going on and happy with my results was when I programmed something graphical. This notion pushed me in the direction of the technology, arts, and media program and CU which focuses on design and user experience through technology and media. Going through the program lead me to the realization that designing the user experience for computer applications and working with media through the computer are what I enjoy, not just sitting around coding. This recognition came to me incredibly late in my schooling career and I’ve definitely had feelings of regret about my major. I’m lucky that I discovered my passion early enough that I could supplement my now frustrating major with work that I truly loved. I wonder now what would have happened if I didn’t find this passion for design. What should be taken out of this experience is that there needs to be more exploration for someone to find out what they are interested in. A small inkling is a good start, but obviously could fail in pointing someone to the right career. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> What also came with this exploration is more insight into how I learned and learning in general. Going through school cannot possible teach everything there is to know about the fields that you want to enter into. Constantly teaching yourself through any means possible is the only way to survive. This was learned when I found that the material taught in class was not nearly enough to pass the class. However, this learned skill is now invaluable. Knowing how to teach myself a skill is probably the most important part of my education and probably one of the major goals of going to university even if it isn’t mentioned. It is not just the ability to teach oneself, but also how to be resourceful in finding ways to teach oneself. Learning how to use not just teachers, but also peers, books, the Internet and really any means possible is incredibly important. I’ve seen many times where my mom or someone in an older generation doesn’t know how to do something and they also don’t know how to teach themselves because they don’t know where to go to learn. Surviving in the modern world where there are so many skills that are relevant and needed requires such resourcefulness. This also has the bonus of picking out the skills that I’m truly interested in learning. If I find myself learning a new skill, then I know that the skill is worth learning for me to further my career. Tricking myself this way is another skill that I’ve learned. </p> 
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> Bringing all of this together I’m able to build a sort of guideline to my own education and how to expand it. First, explore as much as possible to find everything interesting and important. Next, be adaptable and resourceful so that anything can be learned. By doing these my education will keep expanding for as long as I live. All I want to do is keep learning. </p>
