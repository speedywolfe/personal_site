      <p class="page_section_content"> <span class="ehp_small_header"> MyThinkSpace:</span>	<p class="page_section_paragraph"> During my junior year I took a class called startup Essentials. This class was dedicated to teaching the fundamentals of starting a company from coming up with an idea to validating the idea to quick prototyping. The majority of the class was focused on a single project where we would go through the entire process as if we were starting a company and the end product of the class was a presentation at the New Venture Challenge where there was a cash prize and many investors looking for potential companies to invest in. </p>	<p class="page_section_paragraph">This project was done in groups of two to five people with my group being just myself and one other classmate. The project started with the idea of simplifying the writing process between different authors by providing a place to put writing to be edited by others. The target audience was creative authors and academics writing research papers. The First step within the startup process was to prove that our idea was a feasible and had an audience of some sort. This is done through empathy interviews with our potential customer segment. </p> 
 <p class="page_section_paragraph">Through these interviews we learned that the current collaboration process for writing is difficult to say the least. The problems lied mostly with not having a place where research materials and notes could be placed for all collaborators could see at the same time. The old file structure was not sufficient and most of the academics that we talked to resorted to simply emailing all of the materials back and forth. This new information prompted as pivot to a slightly new product. We decided that a virtual corkboard where materials could be pinned, connected and annotated would be a logic step for the product. This change our customer segment slightly from strictly just writers to anybody that could use a way to organize materials for a project. The next step was to interview people within this segment which for us was students and college faculty. The next type of interview was a problem invalidation interview. This type of interview is designed to destroy any biases for the project and test whether or not people actually would use the product if released. We were looking mainly for frustrations that our product could solve. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> These interviews gave more insight and we found that the problem didn’t lie within collaborating and sharing content, but instead with keeping their own materials organized. This realization fueled another pivot towards organizing personal content. The problem then was that people use cloud services to stay organized and are satisfied with these services. We then realized that a problem that they were having was that their content was displayed across many different platforms such as dropbox or evernote. So, we pivoted into a service that interfaced with all of these services, but overlaid an interface over them so that only a single application had to be opened to control all content within these cloud services. With this new idea in tow we did another round of problem invalidation interviews and discovered that this was a product that people wanted and would use. </p> <p class="page_section_paragraph"> With an idea that finally seemed to be worthwhile building we moved on to create a minimum viable product to show potential investors and customers what the product was, this was to gauge interest to see if the product had enough interest to sell and create a business. Our MVP was a video that features myself talking over a low fidelity interface that showed basic interactions that could happen. The video got a decent response, but classmates said that the video was not professional enough so we created another with more interactions and features shown. These videos garnered a decent response. Our third and final MVP that we created then was a sequence of screenshots to accompany a simple website. We shared the website through social media. By this time in the year the New Venture Challenge arrived. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> We presented our potential product to a panel of judges. The response from the judges was very good and many people were interested. We didn’t win anything at the New Venture challenge and then the end of the class arrived. Despite the initial interests there wasn’t much response for the website so we decided to drop the product. The experience however of going through taking an idea and testing for a potential interest was very interesting and I learned a ton. I learned about the development of ideas from a business perspective, how to throw out and change ideas, and how to interview potential clients by looking for problems that they face in daily life. The class itself was useful because in the end my group gave over a dozen presentations to small and large groups, which increased my presentations skill and my confidence in talking in front of groups. Overall it was a great experience that I enjoyed tremendously. </p>
 <span class="ehp_small_header"> Computer Graphics: </span>	<p class="page_section_paragraph"> I took a computer science course that focused on created 3D computer graphics using openGL. I had been interested in graphics for a long time so I was very interested in learning how. The class involved learning the basics of creating objects by drawing polygons, applying textures, and then adding lighting to the scene. Most of the assignment for the class included adding small features to a single scene until the scene had all of the usual graphics elements. The final project however was where we were allowed to be creative. I had to design a scene from the ground up that included interactions. I chose to make a temple in the style of the mayans that lay within a small glade at night. The inside was lit by torches and a throne was in the final room. </p><span class="ehp_small_header"> The Bully Digital Comic: </span>	<p class="page_section_paragraph"> For my Digital Media 2 class I was given a lot of freedom with the final project as long as the project used processing as a programing language and was academic in nature in some way. Meaning that the project had to tackle some sort of weighty topic in some way. I decided to tackle bullying as my topic. With the rest of the project pretty open I decided to combine a few of my favorite things, photography, writing, and comic books. For my project I created a digital comic that would have photos that I took as the panels and would follow a poem I wrote for narration. Mid way through the story the reader could choose a path for the pain character to take which would lead to different endings. The code that allowed this was written in processing by me. What I ended up loving about this project was that I was able to combine many of my different interests from technical to artistic into a single project.	 </p>
