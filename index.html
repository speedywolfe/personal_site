          <p id="about_me_text"> Hello my name is Mitchell Wolfe and I create things. I love designing websites, interefaces, brands, logos, and graphics. However, I also love programming, anywhere from games and computer graphics to unix scripts and generative art, though my passion is web programming. My motivation for all of this is to tell stories through technology.

                <p id="radio_section_markdown" class="resume_words"> As a senior at CU Boulder I worked as team lead with 5 other students to design and implement a DJ assistant tool for Radio 1190. This tool would serve two purposes, first there would be an automated DJ to play when a physical dj was not present at the station. This could be turned on at any time and was required to play continuously until turned off. The station also required that certain ads and station sweepers would be played at specific time of the hour. To manage this a database of all digital songs, ads, and sweepers was created then playlists with all required material would be generated daily at the beginning of the day. When the system is switched into AutoDJ mode a playlist that matched the current hour would be loaded and the song that matched the minute of the hour would start to play. <br>
 The second part of the project was to create an intereface to help live DJs manage sets and live music. For this a database of all CDs in the station was created and daily playlists generated. These playlists however are filled with holes for DJ music picks and can be edited on the fly. This part of the project also included hot buttons and notifications to simplify the flow of being a DJ by allowing sweepers to instantly be queued up and notifications to help mitigate forgotten ads. <br>
 The last part of the project that enveloped both other pieces was creating a logging system to keep track of played songs and ads for legal reasons and creating a backend for admins to add songs to the database, edit custom shows, and tweak playlist creation settings. <br>
 For this project my responsibilities were day to day task management for the team, version control manager using GIT, managing client expectations in response to team resources, and I was lead designer for the interface including User Interface mockups, Coding, and User Experience Testing. This project was web based with AngularJs powering the front end, Django handling admin interactions and custom python creating playlists and other backend interactions. I worked primarily in photoshop for mockups, CSS for interface styling, and some javascript for user interactions.

My group which consisted of me and three others did our work for The Space Research Company which is an aerospace engineering startup company out of the engineering school and CU Boulder. This was a unique expereience because the company was so new that they didn't have any logo or company image at all. So we started with creating a logo. We went through a very larg number of iteration involving the logo as we slowly came to align their ideals for the company with the look that they wanted. Below are a few of my personal logos that emerged from the process. <br>

Once we settled on the logo we designed many smaller assets for them including business cards, a powerpoint template, and a document header. Next was creating a website for the company. They had already started a basic template website with squarespace so we decided to build off of that so that they could easily change in the future despite the lack of control when considering a hand built site. The website can be found here: <a href="http://www.thespaceresearchcompany.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thespaceresearchcompany.com/ </a> <br>

The last piece of design was a promotional video designed to showcase their main product and the steps that clients would have to use it. Their product is a small cube satellite that clients would buy and put experiments into. The video showcased the launch the satellite and how the product would perform in space. This video was created using after effects for 2d animation combined with maya for 3d renders of the product, with images and video shot by me.

                <p id="space_section_markdown" class="resume_words">I worked at Time Warner Cable as a software Engineering intern for two summers during 2013 and 2014. <br>

For the summer of 2013 I worked with a group of three other interns testing prototype set top box hardware such as DVRs. This hardware was focused on playing all media through an HTML5 built intereface as opposed to older interefaces running on legacy software. Our job was to attempt to stream different types of media through the new hardware to see how quickly and easily old media avenues could be changed to the new hardware. The project included writing web applications using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript with an emphasis on music and video streaming APIs. <br>

For the Summer of 2014 I worked with a large software developement team writing the newest web based application for set top boxes. Most of the features for the application were already implemented so I focused mostly on bug fixing and testing for the software. The entirety of the software was written in javascript and included a large number of external libraries for event handling. Daily scrum meetings were held to discuss and implement features and fix bugs.

This included interviewing people to test the viability of a product idea. The class culminated in the New Venture Challenge competition where many startup companies and ideas competed against each other for money. My startup, which consisted of Hannah Thomas and I was based on the idea of linking many different cloud services such as evernote and dropbox into a single experience. A mindmap like structure would try to group and link project that are similar into close proximity even if the projects aren't in close or similar locations on the computer. We tried to show that the folder structure was old fashioned and a new structure was needed. The idea didn't go far because the time needed was too great and we didn't have enough resources. Below is the logo I designed for the project.
