Hello my name is Mitchell Wolfe and I create things. I love designing websites, interefaces, brands, logos, and graphics. However, I also love programming, anywhere from games and computer graphics to unix scripts and generative art, though my passion is web programming. My motivation for all of this is to tell stories through technology.
