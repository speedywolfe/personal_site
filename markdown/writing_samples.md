<p class="page_section_paragraph"> Below are a few writing samples from more technical work that I have complete over the course of my undergraduate career. The first is an analysis of how guilt affects people and shapes future actions. The second is a look at how people fulfill themselves and look to create happiness within their lives. The last is a thesis paper written on a project where I wrote a book that combined text with images to examine how the imagery could enhance the reader's perception of the text.</p>
