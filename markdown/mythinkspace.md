As part of my coursework I took a class based on the fundamentals of creating a startup company. This included interviewing people to test the viability of a product idea. The class culminated in the New Venture Challenge competition where many startup companies and ideas competed against each other for money. My startup, which consisted of Hannah Thomas and I was based on the idea of linking many different cloud services such as evernote and dropbox into a single experience. A mindmap like structure would try to group and link project that are similar into close proximity even if the projects aren't in close or similar locations on the computer. We tried to show that the folder structure was old fashioned and a new structure was needed. The idea didn't go far because the time needed was too great and we didn't have enough resources. Below is the logo I designed for the project.
