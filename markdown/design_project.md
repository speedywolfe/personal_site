<p class="page_section_paragraph"> To complete my minor in Technology, Arts, and Media, my Atlas Capstone Class included a campus service project. This project required getting into a team, finding some group on campus such as a student club or department, and doing some sort of media creation project for them. These projects could be anything from designing logos and business cards to writing music or producing videos. Overall the purpose was to build skills for designing on a team, changing designs based on client needs and increasing abilities with media creation of various types. My team, which consisted of three others and myself, did our project for The Space Research Company. This was a startup that was made up of three graduate students from the aerospace department that planned to manufacture cube satellites for research projects. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> The Space Research Company was still in the absolute beginning stages of company creation, so the basics of their company had yet to be established, including logo and branding. Initially we were told that the creative reigns for designing the look were completely in our group’s hands. With this in mind, the four of us each separately designed a set of logos to gauge and inspire our clients about possibilities of logos and look the company could take on. I based my designs off the idea that research should be the first thing that people should think about when seeing their logo. With this main idea in mind, I also tried to focus on a simple design that was different from the logos of other space-oriented companies. The reasoning for this was that logos for space industries tend to follow a very small set of rules. The orbit or the planet horizon are present in almost every logo which creates a sort of image that holds for the industry as a whole, but makes distinguishing single companies difficult. I wanted to avoid this.</p>

<p class="page_section_paragraph"> The problem that we quickly found was that TSRCo didn’t want to limit the scope of their company within a logo in any way. This meant that they didn’t want Earth in the logo in case they could expand to outer space research in the future. They also weren’t interested in a logo, which included cubes in the design because they thought they might want to expand past cubesats. These design restrictions shot down most of the group’s preliminary logo designs. They also mentioned that the designs should feel spacey with a Tron-like feel. These choices were against what would have been beneficial for the company if they wanted to distinguish themselves apart from Nasa, spaceX and the like, but that’s what they wanted. They believed that if their logo was similar to these companies, then it would be easily recognizable, but as I’ve iterated before, this should be a goal to avoid. </p>
 
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> For several more weeks our team came back with dozens of logos with none of them be satisfactory to the client. Though we seemed to slowly be finding the look that they desired. Next, they gave us a logo they had designed and wanted us to build from. Without any other choice, we tweaked and refined what they had given us, which was an earth with an orbital ring. </p>

<p class="page_section_paragraph"> With the logo basically finalized our team moved on to designing a style guide to help keep consistency throughout their products, presentations, business cards and other elements needed by the company. This style guide included colors they could use and defined the header style for documents, a PowerPoint template for presentations, and Typeface specifications. These elements were quickly completed, though TSRCo did not see the reason for keeping the style of their company so consistent. </p>

<p class="page_section_paragraph"> This left us with the final aspect of the project: a promotional video for them to show to investors at the New Venture Challenge and other presentations. The video was to include the basics of a launch for the cubesat and a demonstration about how easy the research data could be collected without any personnel in space. With these few goals in mind, we wrote a dialogue and created some basic animations in After Effects to gauge what they wanted. They thought we were on the right track, but wanted the animation to be in 3D. We quickly iterated that despite some 3D experience on the team, there was not nearly enough time to create models for the animation and render it. We switched our animation style to be more similar to 3D animation. The other part of the video was to include real footage of them working on their hardware and some pictures of the cubesat or the system on a chip that they had been designing. I went to take the necessary pictures and video and was surprised to found that no hardware actually existed. This fact was incredibly frustrating since we needed that footage to create their promotional video. The footage that I took ended up being their team doing an experiment, which in the end worked quite well. </p>
<p class="page_section_paragraph"> The largest benefit of this project was learning to work with clients and to tweak my own designs continually into a final iteration that was a fusion of both my ideas and their vision. It was at times frustrating when they wouldn’t listen to advice based on the design and marketing classes I had taken, but overall the experience was beneficial. </p>
